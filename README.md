SynergySphere – Advanced Team Collaboration Platform (MVP)

🌐 Overview
SynergySphere is built on a simple idea: teams do their best work when their tools truly support how they think, communicate, and move forward together.
This MVP delivers the foundational features of SynergySphere for both desktop and mobile platforms, focusing on task management and team communication.
At its core, SynergySphere is about helping teams operate at their best — continuously improving, staying aligned, and working smarter every day.

🎯 Mission
Our mission is to design and build a platform that acts like a central nervous system for team collaboration.
Unlike traditional project management tools, SynergySphere works proactively — catching potential issues early and helping teams stay ahead rather than constantly reacting.
This means creating a system that feels supportive, insightful, and seamless — something that naturally fits into the rhythm of a working team.

🚧 Pain Points Addressed

SynergySphere directly targets common challenges faced by teams:
Scattered Information – Centralizes files, chats, and decisions.
Unclear Progress – Provides visibility into task progress and blockers.
Resource Confusion – Balances workloads and clarifies responsibilities.
Deadline Surprises – Surfaces risks before they become issues.
Communication Gaps – Keeps everyone updated and in the loop.
